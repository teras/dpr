Distribution Packer Installer - a front-end to most common installers in Java, e.g. at, brew, pacman, dnf, emerge, choco and zyppo

Instead of having to memorize the operating system and the package manager a system is using, you can use the syntax of your liking and let dpr do the translation for you.
